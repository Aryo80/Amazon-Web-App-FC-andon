# Amazon FC Andon Data Web Application
## Overview
Welcome to my Amazon FC Andon Data Web Application! This project showcases a user-friendly web application built with Python for cleaning, reporting, and visualizing CSV data extracted from the FC Andon app across different areas (P-1-V, P-3-M, P-2-M, P-1-P, P-1-R) and different types of Andon incidents. Leveraging Streamlit and Plotly for visualization, the app presents insights through interactive charts and graphs. Notably, the web app generates detailed reports concerning problem solvers who successfully resolved Andon incidents.

## Features
Data Cleaning: The web application provides data cleaning functionalities to ensure the data is prepared for analysis.
Reporting: Detailed reports are generated, focusing on problem solvers who resolved Andon incidents and hot bins.
Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs using Plotly provide visual insights into the Andon data.
